# find [path] [options] [tests] [actions]

# path could be multipath  such as /  /home/willvegapunk/Programming

#options -depth  # depth first
#        -follow  # get into symbolic link
#        -maxdepths N  # max N directory inside
#        -mount         # Not find in the mounted diskdrive

#tests

#        -atime N   # access time N day ago
#        -mtime N   # modify time N day ago
#        -newer otherfile    #the file is newer than file: otherfile
#        -name [pattern]
#        -type C    #  f:file,  d:directory

# find . \(-newer X  -o -name "_*"\) -type f -print
#  find the file newer than x or name started with _ , make sure it's file and then print out
